Certainly! Below is a basic portfolio website using HTML and CSS that showcases a developer’s project . It includes:
A header with the developer’s name
A single project section
A detailed, continuous paragraph of approximately 500 words
Simple styling for clean readability
In this webpage I used online resources to understand the concept of the task and working on it I also used some advance feautres of CSS and javascript  which make my portfolio webpage interactive .I used avatar images like snapchat or instagram and color combination is very simple.
